# Status Update:
V.1 of the project is Complete! I deployed the model to a simple heroku server and leveraged mercury in order to take advatnage of a simple jupyter notebook framework. As of now I am in the process of writing a user manual/guide and documentation. In addition V.1.1 will come out relatively soon and I plan on adding a few more features on the back and front end of this project.
