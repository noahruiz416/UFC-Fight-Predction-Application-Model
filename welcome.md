:wave: Hello! My name is Noah. I'm a Junior at Arizona State University Studying Mathematics & Statistics with a minor in Economics. I'm passionate about Statistics, Machine Learning and Data Science. I enjoy solving challenging problems with data and have a proven professional track record in analytics and data science. 

Currently I'm interning at Pacific Northwest National Labratory within Geospatial Data Science and at Nationwide Insurance in Close Analytics. In both roles I leverage my background with Statistics to develop advanced analytics solutions.

On this site you will find a wide array of content ranging from personal projects, tutoring services and more.

## :notebook: My Notebooks :notebook:
  - For the UFC Application here is the user guide. I would also recommend reading the model card in the docs: https://github.com/noahruiz416/UFC-Fight-Prediction-Application-Model/blob/main/Docs/UserGuide.md
  - Further excpect to get a simple 'is literal' error on the first run which should go away after the 1st run. Also the error does not effect the prediction quality
  - I would recommend using the test cases in he User Guide, to get an idea of how the model works and see an instance in which the model predicted a correct UFC fight outcome.
