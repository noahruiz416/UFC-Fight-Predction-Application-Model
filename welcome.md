:wave: Hello! My name is Noah. I'm an undergraduate student at Arizona State University Studying Mathematics & Statistics with a minor in Economics. On this page you'll find a collection of my personal projects and a simple application I made to predict UFC fights. I'm passionate about stats, ML and Data Science and enjoy solving challenging problems with data.
